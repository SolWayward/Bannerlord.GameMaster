# API Reference

This is the developer api reference documentation intended for mod developers using BLGM as a framework or helper for their mod.  

If you are looking for the user console command documentation use the below link:  
**[User Command Documentation](https://github.com/SolWayward/Bannerlord.GameMaster/wiki)**  

## System Console
BLGM includes an optional system console that displays additional debug information alongside the game console and allows you to enter commands using the system console or the game console. 

To enable the system console:

**In-Game Command:**  
gm.show_system_console  

**Command Line Launch Option:**  
/systemconsole  

The system console is optional - all commands work in both the game console and system console. The system console additionally shows:
- Debug output and logging
- Detailed command execution information
- System messages and warnings
