## 📖 Documentation Sections

### Getting Started
Start here if you're new to the project or need to set up your development environment. These documents cover the prerequisites, tools, and architectural concepts you need to understand before implementing features.

**When to use:**
- Setting up your development environment
- Learning the project architecture
- Understanding how components interact
- Before starting any implementation work

---

### Implementation
Practical guides for adding new features to the project. Follow the workflow document for the step-by-step process, then use the item management example as a reference for implementing a complete system.

**When to use:**
- Adding a new entity type (Item, Settlement, Party, etc.)
- Implementing new commands or features
- Following the established patterns
- Need a concrete example to follow

---

### Templates
Ready-to-use code templates for each layer of the architecture. Copy these templates and customize them for your specific entity type to ensure consistency with established patterns.

**When to use:**
- Creating a new Extensions class
- Creating a new Queries class
- Adding query commands
- Adding management commands
- Writing tests for new commands

---

### Guides
Best practices, conventions, and procedures for maintaining code quality. Use these guides to ensure your code follows project standards and to debug issues when they arise.

**When to use:**
- Need to understand naming conventions
- Want to organize code properly
- Writing tests
- Debugging test failures
- Troubleshooting command issues
- Before committing code
